# Yarn Version Manager

## `@types/... *` version resolution

### TL;DR

Add the following lines, and replace "17.0.47" with your expected version, to your package.json. Normally you should keep `@types/react` at the same major version with `react`. So, consider using [`^` specifier](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-semantic-versioning#using-semantic-versioning-to-specify-update-types-your-package-can-accept).

```json title="package.json"
"resolutions": {
    "@types/react": "17.0.47"
},
```

### Explanation

Many typescript packages may depend on `"@types/react" "*"` for React typing. However, without further specification, the `*` will be resolved to the latest version.

This will be problematic if the latest React version introduces a breaking change to the current version. For example, I once experienced an error message shown below:

```shell-session
$ <REDACTED>/node_modules/.bin/tsc
src/components/Gallery/index.tsx:13:6 - error TS2786: 'Masonry' cannot be used as a JSX component.
  Its instance type 'Component<MasonryPropTypes, any, any>' is not a valid JSX element.
    The types returned by 'render()' are incompatible between these types.
      Type 'React.ReactNode' is not assignable to type 'import("<REDACTED>/node_modules/@types/react-router-config/node_modules/@types/react/index").ReactNode'.
        Type '{}' is not assignable to type 'ReactNode'.

13     <Masonry options={masonryOptions}>
        ~~~~~~~
```

It turns out that I have multiple `@types/react` installed. Even though I have explicitly required `@types/react 17.0.47` in devDependencies, the `@types/react *` required by other dependencies (such as `@types/react-router-config` in this case) is still resolved to the latest v18.0.14.

</details>

By adding the `resolutions` configuration to package.json, the `@types/react` package is pointing correctly to the React version used (v17), resolving this error message.
